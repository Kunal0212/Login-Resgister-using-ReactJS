        <center><h2>What was unique about ancient Indian education?</h2></center>
        <p>Education in ancient India was quite different from the rest of the world back then. The society and state couldnâ€™t interfere with the curriculum or the administration. To get an education, a child had to leave home and live with a teacher in a gurukul for the entire duration of his studies. No fee was charged for education; in fact, the teacher took care of everything, including food, clothing and housing. According to this system, physical labor was of utmost importance. So, even if a child was interested in acquiring philosophical knowledge, he would still have to do some manual work every day. Debates and discussions were a part of education, even in ancient days.</p>
